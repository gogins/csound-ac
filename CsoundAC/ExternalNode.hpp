 * p5  MIDI velocity number as a real number.
 * p6  Spatial location depth (Ambisonic X axis).
 * p7  Spatial location width (Ambisonic Y axis, stereo pan).
 * p8  Spatial location height (Ambisonic Z axis).
 * p9  Audio phase in radians.
 * p10 Mason number, i.e. a pitch-class set as a sum of powers of 2.
