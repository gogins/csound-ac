This library implements a geometric approach to some common operations on 
chords in neo-Riemannian music theory for use in score generating procedures:

 -  Identifying whether a chord belongs to some equivalence class of music
    theory, or sending a chord to its equivalent within a representative
    ("normal") fundamental domain of some equivalence relation. The
    equivalence relations are octave (O), permutational (P), transpositional,
    (T), inversional (I), and their compounds OP, OPT (set-class or chord
    type), and OPTI (similar to prime form), among others.

 -  Causing chord progressions to move strictly within an orbifold that
    reoresents some equivalence class.

 -  Implementing chord progressions based on the L, P, R, D, K, and Q
    operations of neo-Riemannian theory (thus implementing some aspects of
    "harmony").

 -  Implementing chord progressions performed within a more abstract
    equivalence class by means of the closest voice-leading within a less
    abstract equivalence class (thus implementing some fundamentals of
    "counterpoint").
    
 -  Implementing "functional" or "Roman numeral" operations performed 
    using scales and scale degrees (thus implementing many fundamentals of 
    "pragmatic music theory").
    
# Definitions

Pitch is the perception of a distinct sound frequency. It is a logarithmic
perception; octaves, which sound 'equivalent' in some sense, represent
doublings or halvings of frequency.

Pitches and intervals are represented as real numbers. Middle C is 60 and the
octave is 12. Our usual system of 12-tone equal temperament, as well as MIDI
key numbers, are completely represented by the whole numbers; any and all
other pitches can be represented simply by using fractions.

A voice is a distinct sound that is heard as having a pitch.

A chord is simply a set of voices heard at the same time, represented here
as a point in a chord space having one dimension of pitch for each voice
in the chord.

A scale is a chord with a tonic pitch-class as its first and lowest voice, 
all other voices being pitch-classes sorted in ascending order.

For the purposes of algorithmic composition, a score can be considered to be a 
sequence of more or less fleeting chords.

# Equivalence Relations and Classes

An equivalence relation identifies different elements of a set as belonging to
the same class. For example the octave is an equivalence relation that 
identifies C1, C2, and C3 as belonging to the equivalence class C. Operations 
that send elements to their equivalents induce quotient spaces or orbifolds, 
where the equivalence operation identifies points on one facet of the orbifold 
with points on an opposing facet. The fundamental domain of the equivalence 
relation is the space consisting of the orbifold and its surface.

Plain chord space has no equivalence relation. Ordered chords are represented
as vectors in parentheses (p1, ..., pN). Unordered chords are represented as
sorted vectors in braces {p1, ..., pN}. Unordering is itself an equivalence
relation -- permutational equivalence.

The following equivalence relations apply to pitches and chords, and exist in
different orbifolds. Equivalence relations can be combined (Callendar, Quinn,
and Tymoczko, "Generalized Voice-Leading Spaces," _Science_ 320, 2008), and
the more equivalence relations are combined, the more abstract is the
resulting orbifold compared to the parent space.

In most cases, a chord space can be divided into a number, possibly
infinite, of geometrically equivalent fundamental domains for the same
equivalence relation. Therefore, here we use the notion of 'representative'
or 'normal' fundamental domain. For example, the representative fundamental
domain of unordered sequences, out of all possible orderings, consists of all
sequences in their ordinary sorted order. It is important, in the following,
to identify representative fundamental domains that combine properly, e.g.
such that the representative fundamental domain of OP / the representative
fundamental domain of PI equals the representative fundamental domain of OPI.
And this in turn may require accounting for duplicate elements of the
representative fundamental domain caused by reflections or singularities in
the orbifold (e.g. on vertices, edges, or facets shared by fundamental domains 
with a cyclical structure), or by doubled pitches in a chord.

<dl>
<dt>C   <dd>Cardinality equivalence, e.g. {1, 1, 2} == {1, 2}. _Not_ assuming
        cardinality equivalence ensures that there is a proto-metric in plain
        chord space that is inherited by all child chord spaces. Cardinality
        equivalence is never assumed here, because we are working in chord
        spaces of fixed dimensionality; e.g. we represent the note middle C
        not only as {60}, but also as {60, 60, ..., 60}.
        
<dt>O   <dd>Octave equivalence. The fundamental domain is defined by the pitches
        in a chord spanning the range of an octave or less, and summing to
        an octave or less.

<dt>P   <dd>Permutational equivalence. The fundamental domain is defined by a
        "wedge" of plain chord space in which the voices of a chord are always
        sorted by pitch.

<dt>T   <dd>Transpositional equivalence, e.g. {1, 2} == {7, 8}. The fundamental
        domain is defined as a hyperplane in chord space at right angles to the
        diagonal of unison chords. Represented by the chord always having a
        sum of pitches equal to 0.

<dt>Tg  <dd>Transpositional equivalence; the pitches of the chord are sent to 
        the ceilings of the pitches in the first chord whose sum is equal 
        to or greater than 0, i.e., rounded up to equal temperament.

<dt>I   <dd>Inversional equivalence. Care is needed to distinguish the
        mathematician's sense of 'invert', which means 'pitch-space inversion'
        or 'reflect in a point', from the musician's sense of 'invert', which
        varies according to context but in practice often means 'registral
        inversion' or 'revoice by adding an octave to the lowest tone of a
        chord.' Here, we use 'invert' and 'inversion' in the mathematician's
        sense, and we use the terms 'revoice' and 'voicing' for the musician's
        'invert' and 'inversion'. Here, the inversion of a chord is its 
        reflection in a hyperplane (the inversion flat) that divides a 
        fundamental domain of pitch.

<dt>PI  <dd>Inversional equivalence with permutational equivalence. The
        'inversion flat' of unordered chord space is a hyperplane consisting
        of all those unordered chords that are invariant under inversion. A
        fundamental domain is defined by any half space bounded by a
        hyperplane containing the inversion flat.

<dt>OP  <dd>Octave equivalence with permutational equivalence. Tymoczko's 
        orbifold for chords; i.e. chords with a fixed number of voices in a 
        harmonic context. The fundamental domain is defined as a hyperprism 
        one octave long with as many sides as voices and the ends identified 
        by octave equivalence and one cyclical permutation of voices, modulo 
        the unordering. In OP for trichords in 12TET, the augmented triads run 
        up the middle of the prism, the major and minor triads are in 6
        alternating columns around the augmented triads, the two-pitch chords
        form the 3 sides, and the one-pitch chords form the 3 edges that join
        the sides.
        
<dt>OPT  <dd>The layer of the OP prism as close as possible to the origin, modulo
        the number of voices. Chord type. Note that CM and Cm are different
        OPT. Because the OP prism is canted down from the origin, at least one
        pitch in each OPT chord (excepting the origin itself) is negative. 
        For n dimensions there are n OPT fundamental domains centering on the 
        maximally even chord and generated by rotation about the maximally 
        even chord, equivalently octavewise revoicing, more or less the same 
        as the musician's sense of "chord inversion."

<dt>OPTT  <dd>The same as OPT, but with chords rounded up within equal 
        temperament; equivalent to "chord type."

<dt>OPI  <dd>The OP prism modulo inversion, i.e. 1/2 of the OP prism. The
        representative fundamental consits of those chords having inversional 
        equivalence.

<dt>OPTI  <dd>The OPT layer modulo inversion, i.e. 1/2 of the OPT layer.
        Set-class. Note that minor and major triads are are the same OPTI.

<dt>OPTTI  <dd>The same as OPTI, but with chords rounded up within equal 
        temperament; equivalent to "set class."
</dl>

# Operations

Each of the above equivalence relations is, of course, an operation that sends
chords outside some fundamental domain to chords inside that fundamental 
domain. We define the following additional operations:

<dl>
<dt>T(p, x)     <dd>Translate p by x.

<dt>I(p [, x])  <dd>Reflect p in x, by default the origin.

<dt>P           <dd>Send a major triad to the minor triad with the same root,
                or vice versa (Riemann's parallel transformation).

<dt>L           <dd>Send a major triad to the minor triad one major third higher,
                or vice versa (Riemann's Leittonwechsel or leading-tone
                exchange transformation).

<dt>R           <dd>Send a major triad to the minor triad one minor third lower,
                or vice versa (Riemann's relative transformation).

<dt>D            <dd>Send a triad to the next triad a perfect fifth lower
                (dominant transformation).
</dl>

P, L, and R have been extended as follows, see Fiore and Satyendra,
"Generalized Contextual Groups", _Music Theory Online_ 11, August 2008:

<dl>
<dt>K(c)        <dd>Interchange by inversion;
                `K(c) := I(c, c[1] + c[2])`.
                This is a generalized form of P; for major and minor triads,
                it is exactly the same as P, but it also works with other
                chord types.

<dt>Q(c, n, m)  <dd>Contexual transposition;
                `Q(c, n, m) := T(c, n)` if c is a T-form of m,
                or `T(c, -n)` if c is an I-form of M. Not a generalized form
                of L or R; but, like them, K and Q generate the T-I group.
</dl>
